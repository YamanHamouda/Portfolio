3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.
I did for the 3rd checker, but a way I found around it is literally embedding the code from my css file into my html file, in that way the checker can see the full picture. that's why I was able to get a clean grade on it. I did turn that screenshot in, and not the one where the html file seems independent of the css file;

6-8 hours.


5. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)
I used generative AI to learn how different tags work and what properties I can add to do specific things like make a button grow bigger when hovered over.


6. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
Majd Katabi. We didn't share any code it was more like "Oh how are you doing on the assignment" type.

I hope not haha.
